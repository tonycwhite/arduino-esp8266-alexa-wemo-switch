This is a take on the kakopappa wemo switch to suit a SONOFF basic switch from the outset.

Changes made are
  The device name is now dictated at the top, in amogst the wifi settings.
  The relay GPIO is now correct for the SONOFF basic
  Once wifi is connected, you are presented with the device MAC address should you wish to set up static IPs
  
TO DO
  read the device switch toactivate the lamp.

The basic script this is forked from does all the hard work, so all credit to kakopappa, i've just tweaked it to make it sonoff ready.
